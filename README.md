In this Dashboard I put together a series of data that allows the user to distigusish certain informations from the diagrams of Data. This Dashbaord is interactive which allows user to find specific information which makes it easier to find specific data. For example you can find which month made the most money. Another example is finding how much money a certain product made.

This is an example of a pivot chart i used to sort the data It allows me to nit pick certain data to get certain data. If your wondering what a pivot table is "A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. You can use a PivotTable to analyze numerical data in detail, and answer unanticipated questions about your data."

This is an example of a graph I made to see the data in a visual context which allows you to see the data rather than read it. I used Column graph which sorted the data by country, price, and product. If your wondering what a column graph is "a column graph is a type of bar graph that compares data using vertical bars. Every column graph has four main parts: title, labels, scale, and categories. Graphs are a perfect way to display your data in a manner that's easy to read and understand."
